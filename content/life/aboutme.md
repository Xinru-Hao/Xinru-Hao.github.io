Hi, I am Xinru Hao, an adept Data Analyst currently shaping the future of data-driven strategies at GYE Zone LLC. My academic journey in statistics was honed at Columbia University, where I completed my Master's degree, and earlier, I laid my mathematical foundation at Boston University with a Bachelor's in Mathematics, concentrating on Statistics, complemented by a minor in Economics.

In my current role, I am immersed in the world of analytics, leveraging my proficiency in Python, R, SAS, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI to transform vast datasets into actionable insights. With a firm grounding in machine learning and statistical analysis, I strive to bring precision and foresight into the intricate process of decision-making.

My expertise is not just confined to crunching numbers; it extends to creating compelling narratives through data visualization that informs and influences strategic business decisions. Whether it's improving model accuracy or pioneering advanced data preprocessing techniques, I am committed to elevating the analytics landscape with each project I undertake.
